In order to build all, just run as root ./script/build-all

In the script folder are also provided scripts to compile
every single library needed, each named build-LIBRARY,
where LIBRARY is the library name.

It is assumed that the toolchain path is /opt/mipsel-linux-uclibc,
otherwise you will need to change the prefix path into the script.
